# Context Hub Plugin

Unified context retrieval for Claude Code - orchestrates **Pluggable Memory Backend (Graphiti/Forgetful)**, **Context7 documentation**, and **Serena symbol analysis** into a single context-gathering workflow.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins install context-hub-plugin --marketplace forgetful-plugins
```

Or install from local path:
```bash
claude plugins install /path/to/context-hub-plugin
```

## Configuration

Context Hub supports pluggable memory backends. Create `.context-hub.yaml`:

```yaml
memory:
  backend: "graphiti"  # or "forgetful"
  group_id: "auto"     # auto-detect from git repo
```

**Supported Backends:**
- **Graphiti**: Knowledge graph with automatic entity extraction (recommended)
- **Forgetful**: Atomic memories with explicit linking

Backend is auto-selected from config. Group ID is auto-detected from git repository.

See [Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION.md) for details.

## Prerequisites

Context Hub requires these plugins to be installed:

### Required: Serena (for `/encode-repo-serena`)
```bash
claude plugins install serena
```

### Recommended: Context7 (for framework docs in `/context_gather`)
```bash
claude plugins install context7 --marketplace pleaseai/claude-code-plugins
```

## Setup

Run the setup command to configure Forgetful MCP and verify prerequisites:

```bash
/context-hub-setup
```

This will:
1. Check if Serena and Context7 plugins are installed
2. Configure Forgetful MCP server
3. Report setup status

## Skills

Context Hub includes auto-discovered skills that guide Claude on effective tool usage:

### Memory Skills (included)
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `using-memory-adapter` | When/how to query and save memories using pluggable backend (Graphiti/Forgetful) |
| `curating-memories` | Updating, linking, and marking memories obsolete (Forgetful-specific) |
| `exploring-knowledge-graph` | Deep traversal across the knowledge graph |

### Serena Skills
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `using-serena-symbols` | When to use Serena vs grep, symbol path notation, core tools |
| `serena-code-architecture` | Multi-phase architectural analysis workflow with Forgetful integration |

Skills are automatically invoked by Claude when relevant to your task. They include:
- **Tool Quick Reference** - Call Forgetful tools directly without meta-tool discovery
- **TOOL_REFERENCE.md** - Complete schemas for all 38 Forgetful tools

## Commands

### Context Retrieval

| Command | Description | Prerequisites |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `/context_gather <task>` | Gather context from all sources | Forgetful, Context7 (recommended) |
| `/encode-repo-serena` | Bootstrap repository into Forgetful using symbol analysis | Forgetful, Serena |

### Memory Management

| Command | Description | Prerequisites |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `/memory-search <query>` | Search memories semantically | Forgetful |
| `/memory-list [count]` | List recent memories | Forgetful |
| `/memory-save` | Save current context as atomic memory | Forgetful |
| `/memory-explore <query>` | Deep knowledge graph traversal | Forgetful |

### Setup

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/context-hub-setup` | Configure Forgetful MCP and check plugin prerequisites |

## How It Works

### /context_gather

The main command orchestrates multiple sources:

1. **Forgetful Memory** - Searches your knowledge base across ALL projects
2. **File System** - Reads actual code files referenced by memories
3. **Context7** - Retrieves framework-specific documentation (if installed)
4. **Serena** - Provides symbol-level code analysis (if installed)
5. **WebSearch** - Falls back to web for recent information

Returns a synthesized summary with:
- Relevant memories and their connections
- Code patterns and snippets
- Framework guidance
- Architectural decisions
- Implementation notes

### /encode-repo-serena

Uses Serena's LSP-powered analysis for accurate repo encoding:
- **Symbol extraction** - Classes, functions, methods with precise locations
- **Relationship discovery** - Who calls what, what depends on what
- **Cross-file analysis** - Understand component connections

Stores findings as atomic memories in Forgetful for future retrieval.

## Example Usage

```bash
# Before implementing a feature
/context_gather implement OAuth2 authentication for the API

# Bootstrap a new project into the knowledge base
/encode-repo-serena

# Quick memory search
/memory-search authentication patterns

# Save an important decision
/memory-save
```
